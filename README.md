# Child Template
### *Package Name*: child-template

## Purpose
This is the boilerplate for a child-module in the [d2l-to-canvas-conversion-tool](https://github.com/byuitechops/d2l-to-canvas-conversion-tool). Use this template when creating a new child module.

## Setup

When creating a new child module from this template **DO NOT CLONE** this repository (Download it instead). This just helps make sure we don't overwrite this template repository.

These are the steps to turn this boilerplate into your very own child module:
1. Download this repository (**DO NOT CLONE** - we don't want you to overwrite this boilerplate).
2. Extract and rename repository.
    -  Name your repository what action it performs & what item it affects.
3. Create a new git repository on GitHub.
4. Initialize a new git repository locally & connect it to GitHub.
5. Update package.json
    - The following fields need to be updated: 
        - name
        - description
        - `repository.url`
        - author
        - `bugs.url`
        - homepage
        -childType
6. Fill out `readme template.md` and rename it `README.md` (replace this readme)
5. Use `main.js` to start Coding! ðŸ˜„
